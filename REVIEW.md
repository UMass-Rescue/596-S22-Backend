###### Review 1 by Satwik Goyal
1. Documentation: I think the README file is very well written to setup the backend. The comments in the code files are great as well!
2. Version Control: I believe you had made great use of version control and each commit has well written decriptions.
3. Naming Conventions: I think the naming convention used are great and very intuitive.
4. Modularity: You have done a great job at decomposing the code into seperate code files.
5. Testability: I didn't see any tests (please let me know if I missed them). Maybe adding a few test cases could make the code more robust/ready.

Final Note: Honestly I don't have much experience with backend so I cannot give any technical feedback on the code. 
However, from a software engineering perspective this code follows all best pratices. Maybe adding a few test cases might help (although
I am not sure how testing works for the backend).
